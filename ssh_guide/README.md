# ssh guide

This is a general guide to ssh. My experience is from Apple (MacBook Pro) to Ubuntu. If you are going from Windows you will need [putty](http://www.putty.org/). Linux to Linux should work very similar to this guide below (but not tested). To the best of my knowledge, there are no differences between different distros, but I could be wrong. 

Most everything should be contained in your `~/.ssh/` folder from your `$HOME` directory. If you are not familiar this, it would be in your `/Users/username/` folder on Mac or `/home/username/` folder on Ubuntu (Linux). The main files are:

* `authorized_keys`
* `known_hosts`
* `sshd_config`
* `config` 

Public keys get added to your `authorized_keys` file (as text). You can edit the `sshd_config` file to change many settings that you will need to make your computer safer and easier to use off ssh. Add key names to your `config` file when necessary. 

## What is ssh?

"The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution. 

SSH applications are based on a clientâ€“server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server. SSH operates as a layered protocol suite comprising three principal hierarchical components: the transport layer provides server authentication, confidentiality, and integrity; the user authentication protocol validates the user to the server; and the connection protocol multiplexes the encrypted tunnel into multiple logical communication channels." - ![Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)




## SSH to GitHub

Use the following links to connect via SSH to your GitHub account:

1. [Get a key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)
2. [Add key to your account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)
3. [Test Connection](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection)

Then you should be good to go!




## General SSH How-To

### Install Software on Host

```bash
# Must install software on host (Ubuntu machine)
sudo apt-get install openssh-client 
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
```

### check ssh

```bash
sudo service ssh status (host)
```

### restart ssh after installing or editing

```bash
sudo restart ssh (host)
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Files to edit

```bash
vi sshd_config 
vi ssh_config 
```

### Steps to Success

***

Steps to success for Mac to Ubuntu ssh:

  1) `$ ssh-keygen -t rsa` (on host, Ubuntu)
  		* Enter passphrase (2x)

  2) change permissions, `$ chmod 600` for both private/public key (on host)

  3) add pubkey to authorized keys by just copy/paste with vi or any text editor (on host Ubuntu)
      * For this you should just be able to do `cat key_name.pub >> authorized_keys`
      
      ![authorized_keys file](/ssh_guide/authorized_keys.png?raw=true "authorized_keys file")

  4) add the `sshd_config` file (on host Ubuntu) to set your personal settings (there is much more safety you can add)
  		* PermitRootLogin no
  		* PubkeyAuthentication yes
  		* RSAAuthentication yes
  		* X11forwarding yes
  
      ![sshd_config](/ssh_guide/sshd_config.png?raw=true "sshd_config file")

  5) transfer private key (the one without the .pub on it) to remote Mac (the remote computer, can do via email or scp/rsync)

  6) set `$ chmod 600` for that key (on remote Mac, make it private, only you see for safety)

  7) `$ ssh-add key_name` on remote Mac (this should add this key to your list)

  8) Add key name to `config` file (on remote Mac)
  
      ![config](/ssh_guide/config.png?raw=true "config file")
  
  9) restart server ssh with `$ sudo service ssh restart` (on host Ubuntu)
  
  10) connect from Mac with `$ ssh -Y username@IPaddress` or use the hostname after `@`, either is 
  fine but the hostname should be more robust in case the IP changes
  
  11) optional but recommended: add to your `.bash_profile` to ssh quickly to the machine (on remote Mac)
  
      ![bash_profile](/ssh_guide/bash_profile.png?raw=true "bash_profile file")
