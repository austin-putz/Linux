# Linux

This page will hopefully include helpful Unix/Linux scripts for 
animal breeders and data analysts. 

## ssh guide

This guide should help new users with ssh. It's the guide I use everytime I forget how to 
ssh from my Mac to my Ubuntu machine, but should work for any UNIX/Linux system I think. 

## File Extension Highlighting

This will highlight certain file extensions certain colors. You can add or change your own in the script.

## gnuplot

This is Linux's plotting system using space or tab delimited files. I haven't used it much, but it can be very handy. You don't need to load data into R to get a quick plot.
