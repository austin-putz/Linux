# gnuplot

Is a very flexible plotting system for major operating systems. 

## Relationship Matrix (A) Example

ch2.ped = pedigree from chapter 2 in Mrode (2014)

plotA.gnuplot = script with options to plot the A matrix

A.png = output file from the script

The example is plotting a relationship matrix with an A matrix (n x n).
The script has extra stuff for other plots I was trying.

Use by: 
```
gnuplot plotA.gnuplot
```
